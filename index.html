    <p>A quiet place made only for you.</p>

<section>
    <h2>About You</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
        This space is dedicated to the person who changed my days without even trying.
        Not loudly. Not suddenly. But slowly, deeply, and in ways I didn’t expect.
        </p>
        <p>
        You are not just someone I talk to.  
        You are someone I think about even in silence.
        </p>
    </div>

<section>
    <h2>My Words For You</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p class="quote">
        "If I were reborn a thousand times, in every timeline, in every version of life,
        I would still choose you without hesitation."
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <p>
        I am not perfect.  
        I get overwhelmed. I get anxious. I overthink.  
        But one thing that stays consistent is this:
        I care about you sincerely.
        </p>
    </div>

<section>
    <h2>Memories & Moments</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
        The late night talks.  
        The voice messages.  
        The small “I love you” that somehow means more than long paragraphs.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Even the misunderstandings we faced…  
        they didn’t make me walk away.  
        They made me reflect more.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>My Promise</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
        I won’t disappear when things get heavy.  
        I won’t escape into silence instead of communicating.  
        And I won’t make you feel ignored again as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        Not just words.  
        Actions. Consistency. Effort.
        </p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Final Note</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p class="quote">
        You are not just a chapter.  
        You are a presence that stayed even on my worst days.
        </p>
        <p>
        This website isn’t loud.  
        It’s not for the world.  
        It’s just a quiet portfolio of how much you mean to me.
        </p>
        <p class="heart">♥ Always yours.</p>
